# K.A.L.K.I.
### *The Final Avatar · Autonomous AI*

A Windows-native, voice-first AI personal assistant inspired by JARVIS from Iron Man — built from scratch in Python and a single HTML file. Named after Kalki, the final avatar of Vishnu.

Lives quietly in the background. Wakes on **"Hey KALKI"**. Speaks in a natural neural voice. Manages your day, runs your code, hacks your hashes, scans websites for vulnerabilities, and reads your calendar — all through one Iron Man-style HUD.

---

## Highlights

- 🎙 **Voice-first, always-on** — "Hey KALKI" wake word; cloud STT, with an optional **offline Vosk** engine. Built-in-mic selection keeps Bluetooth headsets in high-quality A2DP.
- 🧠 **Smart model routing** — casual turns use a fast 8B model, code/cyber turns use LLaMA-3.3-70B. **Offline fallback** to a local Ollama model.
- 🔐 **Web vulnerability scanner** — *"scan this website"* reads your open browser tab, audits TLS / headers / cookies / CORS / exposed files / dangerous methods, pulls the source + JS, hunts leaked secrets, maps the form/injection surface, and runs active reflected-XSS / open-redirect checks. Non-destructive, findings + fixes.
- 🛰 **Site Watchdog** — background monitor for your sites: down/recovered alerts + SSL-expiry warnings (14/7/2 days).
- 📋 **Clipboard genie** — *"decode my clipboard"* auto-detects JWT / base64 / hex / hashes.
- 🌅 **Morning security brief** — new critical CVEs relevant to your stack + watched-site status.
- 🎨 **Indian "Mahal" HUD** — maroon + gold, jali lattice, an Ashoka-chakra / lotus / Surya mandala reactor, rangoli accents.

## Features

### Voice & Intelligence
- **Always-on wake-word** — say "Hey KALKI" from anywhere; works even when the browser tab is closed
- **Voice-only operation** — listener captures the follow-up sentence after wake; no clicks needed
- **Groq-powered brain** — `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for thinking, `llama-4-scout` for vision
- **Neural TTS** — Microsoft edge-tts `en-GB-RyanNeural` (the closest thing to the movie voice)
- **Stop command** — say "stop" anywhere and the audio cuts instantly

### Personal Assistant
- **Google Calendar** — speaks today's + tomorrow's events on every boot
- **Auto event reminders** — KALKI warns you 15 minutes before every meeting, unprompted
- **Gmail (Primary filter)** — reads only important unread mail; ignores promotions, social, updates, forums, spam
- **Tasks + reminders** — natural-language "remind me to X in 10 minutes" / "at 5 PM"
- **Notes + journal** — "take a note", "what did I note yesterday", `#tags` parsed automatically
- **Password vault** — DPAPI-encrypted (Windows user-account locked, no master password)
- **WhatsApp messaging** — "send a WhatsApp to Dev saying I'll be late" (via pywhatkit)
- **Spotify control** — "play lo-fi", "next song", "pause", "what's playing"; auto-launches if not running
- **Workflow modes** — "study mode", "gaming mode", "CTF mode" trigger multi-step action chains

### Cybersecurity Toolkit
- **Hashes** — identify, generate (MD5/SHA1/SHA256/SHA512/SHA3/NTLM/MD4), and dictionary-crack
- **Encode/decode** — base64, hex, URL, rot13, binary, morse
- **CVE intel** — `lookup CVE-2024-3094` (NVD API) and "recent critical CVEs" (last 30 days, newest first)
- **Subdomain enumeration** — via crt.sh with hackertarget.com fallback
- **GitHub dorking** — pre-baked search URLs for AWS keys, API keys, passwords, .env files, SSH keys
- **Reverse shell payloads** — Bash, sh, Python, Python3, PowerShell, nc, mkfifo, PHP, Perl, Ruby
- **Port scan / DNS / HTTP headers / WHOIS / ping** — fast TCP probe of the standard 42 ports
- **WiFi password recovery** — own networks via `netsh wlan show profile`
- **Screen vision** — Groq vision API analyzes screenshots ("look at my screen and solve this")

### Vision & File Upload
- **Click 📎, drag-and-drop anywhere, or paste Ctrl+V** to attach images / code / text
- Images go to Groq vision for analysis (CTF challenges, code screenshots, error dialogs)
- Text/code files are prepended to your message so the AI sees full content

### Code Engine
- **"Write and run a Python script that scans port 80 on 10 IPs"** — generates, saves, executes
- Python, PowerShell, Batch, Node, HTML
- Scripts saved to `data/scripts/` with timestamps

### Proactive Alerts (background)
- **Battery** — speaks unprompted at <20% and <10%
- **CPU** — sustained high (>95% for 3 consecutive checks)
- **RAM** — over 90%
- All alerts have cooldowns (8–25 minutes) to avoid spam

### The HUD
- **Arc reactor center** — 60fps canvas, 72 mic-reactive frequency bars, 32 orbiting particles, 12 hex cells, 6 petal flares, rotating text rings ("KALKI · GROQ · LLAMA · NEURAL"), pulse ring on state change
- **State-reactive theme** — entire UI shifts hue when KALKI is idle/listening/thinking/speaking (panels, brand mark, readout stripes all retune)
- **Live HUD panels** — CPU/RAM/disk/network/power bars, today's calendar, unread mail count, now-playing track, scrolling telemetry stream
- **Code blocks with copy button** — KALKI replies with triple-backtick fences; UI renders them in monospace with a one-click COPY chip
- **No "asterisk asterisk" in TTS** — markdown stripped before speaking

   launcher.py (silent boot, registers HKCU\...\Run)
```

**Why stdlib only for the server?** No Flask, no FastAPI, no npm — KALKI depends on `python -m http.server`'s threading model and a single HTML file. Easier to audit, faster to start, runs forever without a build step.

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.11
- A microphone
- A free [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com)

### Install
```bat
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/kalki.git C:\Kalki
cd C:\Kalki
copy config.example.py config.py
:: Edit config.py and paste your GROQ_API_KEY
INSTALL.bat
```

`INSTALL.bat` runs:
```bat
py -3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
```bat
START.bat
```

Within 2 seconds you'll hear *"Good morning, Sir. It's Sunday. Sunny 30 outside."* Chrome opens to `http://localhost:8888` and the HUD appears.

### Make it auto-start on every boot
```bat
py -3.11 launcher.py
```
That registers KALKI under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` and drops a Startup-folder shortcut. From then on, KALKI launches silently on every login. To uninstall autostart, remove the `KALKI_v5` registry value.

### Optional integrations
| Integration | One-time setup |
|---|---|
| **Google Calendar + Gmail** | Create OAuth client at console.cloud.google.com (Desktop type, redirect `http://localhost`), download JSON to `data/google_credentials.json`, run `py -3.11 setup_google.py` |
| **Spotify** | Create app at developer.spotify.com/dashboard (redirect `http://127.0.0.1:8889/callback`), paste Client ID/Secret into config.py, run `py -3.11 setup_spotify.py` |
| **Tesseract OCR** (vision fallback) | Install from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki |
| **Wordlist for hash cracking** | Drop a wordlist at `data/wordlist.txt` |
